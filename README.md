Decomposing control systems when used in biomanufacturing processes to robotic control processes.

Motivation: Integrate knowledge and hands-on embedded systems, low-level hardware, system architecture concepts. In process manufacturing control. To develop stronger fundamentals for robotics controls applications.

Objective: Building a biosensor hardware Arduino system and coding/developing system architecture, software, used as an open source PLC\SCADA version. Called Mango.
